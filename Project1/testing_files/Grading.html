<h1>Grading</h1>

<p><small>[<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring21/cs131/index.html">131 home</a>]</small></p>

<p>Grading weights are as follows.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr> <td> 32% </td><td> homeworks </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 24% </td><td> midterm </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 44% </td><td> final exam </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Homeworks are weighted equally except for the Project, which is
worth double.</p>

<p>You must get a passing grade in the homeworks to pass the course.</p>

<p>Exams are open book, open notes, and (if given remotely) open
Internet search.
You must do exams by yourself.
No written makeup exams will be given.</p>

<p>The lateness penalty for an assignment that is submitted between
<var>N</var> and <var>N</var>+1 full days late (where <var>N</var> is
nonnegative) is 2<sup><var>N</var></sup>% of the assignment's value.
That is, the penalty is 1% for being up to 1 day late, 2% for being
from 1 to 2 days late, 4% for being from 2 to 3 days late, and so
forth. Assignments are not accepted after the last day of instruction
(this is typically the Friday before final exams), and are not
accepted after the lateness penalty renders them irrelevant to the
final grade.</p>

<p>Students are responsible for upholding the highest standards
of <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/academic-integrity">academic
integrity</a>, and this includes following the <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/individual-student-code">UCLA
Student Conduct Code</a>, which prohibits cheating,
fabrication or falsification, plagiarism,
multiple submissions, and facilitating academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>Students are encouraged to study together, and to discuss general
problem-solving techniques that are useful on assignments; but when
working on an assignment students should not share detailed notes,
pseudocode or code, and all work submitted must be done
individually. In particular, you should not publish your work
on sites like GitHub, and you should not use a search engine
like Google to find solutions that others may have published.
If you have questions about the policy, please discuss
them with the instructor.</p>
